# BreedHorse

![Love under the cherry trees...and speed potion](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/1134/129/2025-03-22-201835-png.png)

It actually comes from a strange [bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-81890).

In Bedrock Edition, if you use a speed (or jump) potion on two rideable animals, then breed them, their offspring will have higher stats. By doing this repeatedly, you can stack the effect infinitely...

This mod/plugin does not implement this, it's just a crude imitation. Of course, you can set a limit to prevent players from breeding animals with too high stats.

# Config
```yaml
pig:
  enabled: true
  move:
    random:
      min: 0.03
      max: 0.06
    max: 0.3375
horse:
  enabled: true
  move:
    random:
      min: 0.03
      max: 0.06
    max: 0.3375
  jump:
    random:
      min: 0.04
      max: 0.11
    max: 1.0
donkey:
  enabled: true
  move:
    random:
      min: 0.03
      max: 0.06
    max: 0.3375
  jump:
    random:
      min: 0.04
      max: 0.11
    max: 1.0
mule:
  enabled: true
  move:
    random:
      min: 0.03
      max: 0.06
    max: 0.3375
  jump:
    random:
      min: 0.04
      max: 0.11
    max: 1.0
other:
  mixed-properties: false
```

Don't set the speed too high, or the horses/pigs may start to trigger anti-cheat measures, although they may have already affected it.
