# BreedHorse

~~~ 
Let the horses breed better offspring under the effect of potion? 
~~~


It actually comes from a strange mechanism (possibly a bug?) in the Bedrock edition where if you use speed potions on two horses and then breed them, their offspring will be even faster. By doing this repeatedly you can stack the effect infinitely...

This plugin does not achieve that, it's just a crude imitation. Of course you can set a limit to prevent your players from breeding a horse so fast it crashes your server, haha.

# Config
```
moveSpeed:
    str1: 0.03
    str2: 0.06
    max: 0.3375

jumpStrength:
    str1: 0.04
    str2: 0.11
    max: 1.0
```
str1 and str2 are random value intervals, and they should not be set too high.

Don't set the speed too high, or the horses may start to trigger anti-cheat measures, although they may have already affected it haha.
